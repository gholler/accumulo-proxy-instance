ProxyInstance
=============

This is an implementation of the Accumulo `Instance` Application Programming Interface (API) which uses the Accumulo-supplied, Apache Thrift-based
proxy server as the back-end for communicating with an Accumulo instance.

This is also a fork of a fork by UNAUTRE of [an original implementation by the JHUAPL](https://github.com/JHUAPL/accumulo-proxy-instance).
Kudos to them, for the orginal implementation and the upgrade to Accumulo 1.9.3.

For more information, see the [Users' Manual](http://jhuapl.github.io/accumulo-proxy-instance/proxy_instance_user_manual.html).

This project is not yet pushed to maven central, but I'll work on it.
